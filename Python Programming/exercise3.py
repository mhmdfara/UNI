# Comments explaining the approach
# - Created a straightforward neural network without bias to model functions passing through the origin.
# - Recognized the limitation that the model is restricted to functions intersecting (0,0).
# - Utilized synthetic data for training and assessed model performance on test data.

# Comments on challenges and solutions
# - Challenge: No bias could constrain the model's flexibility.
# - Solution: Addressed this by incorporating multiple neurons or layers to capture more intricate relationships.
